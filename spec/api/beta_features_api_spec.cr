  # Update production instance domain
  # Change the domain of a production instance.  Changing the domain requires updating the [DNS records](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/overview#dns-records) accordingly, deploying new [SSL certificates](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/overview#deploy), updating your Social Connection&#39;s redirect URLs and setting the new keys in your code.  WARNING: Changing your domain will invalidate all current user sessions (i.e. users will be logged out). Also, while your application is being deployed, a small downtime is expected to occur.
